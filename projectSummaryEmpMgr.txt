# Project Summary
- In this project we are building a front end for an employee management system. It should run on any modern browser (post I.E. 8 and similar), and be fully functional, and reasonably styled. Chrome will be our recommended browser. Access the app here.

##Current Desired Functionality
###Employee List
- The application will load a simulated list of employees, and allow modifications to each. Clicking the employee from the list to the side will bring their file up in the editor.

###Add Employee
- “Add Employee” option at the bottom will allow a new employee record to be created, defaulting with the name and title “New Employee”, phone number (111)111-1111, and an ID number one greater than the last employee created, so that IDs are never repeated.

###Selected Employee
- Your employee will consist of:

>ID
>Name
>Phone
>Title
>All fields except for ID are editable.

###ID - Should be whole numbers between 0 and 9999 Name - Any characters allowed, to a maximum of 30 characters Phone - Must be a 10 digit phone number

>>Accepted as regular digits or formatted as a US number
>>If entered as the former will be displayed as the latter Title - Any characters allowed, to a maximum of 30 characters Email - Any valid email address, to a maximum of 30 characters
###Save, Cancel, Delete
>>Save: When saving a change, it will persist as you access other records and navigate back to the desired employee.

>>If there are unacceptable entries in the fields, an error message will pop up advising the users as to the errors they need to fix.

###Cancel: The cancel button will revert the employee’s file back to the most recently saved version.

###Delete: The delete button will remove the employee record, and is irriversable. A dialogue asking the user to confirm their desire to remove the record will be presented.

>>The save and cancel buttons will only be accessible when modifications have been made.

###Search
- The search bar will compare any inputs to all fields on all employees, and filter the employee list for any employee that has at least one match.
- The clear button will empty the search field and revert to display ALL employees.
- Adding, modifying, or deleting employees while the search field is populated will update the results.

##Future Functionality
###To be aware of, but not currently implementedgit

- Phone numbers will be validated 10 digit, area code included, US phone numbers.
- The Employee List will reside in a database and be accessed through API integration.
- The API endpoint is currently https://peaceful-inlet-88854.herokuapp.com/api/employees

##Basic API documentation is as follows:
>>GET: will return an array of employees
>>POST: will add an employee if the Body of the request contains a JSON with the properties id, name, phone, email, and title
>>PUT: will edit an existing employee when sent to api/employees/{employeeId} with parameters of name, phone, email, and title

>>>>Note, ID is not editable

>>DELETE: will delete an existing employee when the request is sent to api/employees/{employeeId}
>>Any request will return an array of the current employees in the database.
>>An Add Employee function will be implemented.
>>A search function to filter the employee list will be available, based on Job Title, Name, and/or ID
>>An Email Address field will be added for each employee file
>>All fields will be required for any entry/modification
